## 👋 Hey, I'm Mohammed Lazhari

Welcome to the hub of all things **platform engineering**, **full-stack development**, and **SRE wizardry**. When I'm not architecting solutions or securing infrastructures, I'm likely diving deep into the world of **blockchain** or chasing the latest in tech innovations.

### 🚀 About Me
- **🌍 Full-Stack Developer**: Whether it's wrangling React, taming Next.js, juggling Angular, crafting backend sorcery with Go, or conjuring up APIs with Node.js, I code it all with a smile (and plenty of coffee).
- **🔧 Platform Engineer**: Making systems scalable, reliable, and (almost) indestructible.
- **👁️‍🗨️ SRE**: Keeping the lights on, one uptime metric at a time.
- **💻 Blockchain Enthusiast**: Believer in the decentralized future, one block at a time.

### 🌟 My Tech Stack

#### 🛠️ Programming Languages
- **Go**: The reliable Swiss army knife of my coding toolkit.
- **JavaScript**: Because who doesn't love a bit of chaos in their life?
- **TypeScript**: JavaScript's responsible big sibling who keeps everything in check.
- **Node.js**: Turning JavaScript into a backend beast.
- **Solidity**: The secret sauce for cooking up some decentralized magic.

#### 🌐 Web Development Frameworks
- **React**: Crafting UIs with enough components to rival a LEGO set.
- **Next.js**: For when you want your React apps to grow up and be responsible.
- **Angular**: The heavy lifter that makes sure everything stays in line.
- **Nest**: The backend framework that’s as cozy as its name.
- **Express**: The minimalistic server that does the job and asks for nothing in return.
- **GoFiber** & **Gin**: Because sometimes you just need some Go-powered speed to serve your apps.

#### 🏗️ Backend and API Development
- **Microservices**: Why have one big service when you can have lots of little ones?
- **REST APIs**: The old faithful of backend communication.
- **GraphQL**: For those days when your APIs need to answer questions like a scholar.
- **gRPC**: When you need your services to talk fast and efficiently.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Who needs servers? Let’s go server-less and sleepless!

#### 🔧 SRE and DevOps
- **Docker**: Packaging apps like they're going on a world tour.
- **Kubernetes**: Herding containers like a digital cowboy.
- **Ansible, Pulumi, Terraform, Helm**: Automating everything because why click when you can script?
- **Grafana Stack**: Because seeing is believing, especially in monitoring.
- **OWASP, Teleport, Wazuh, SonarQube**: Keeping security tighter than my morning coffee routine.

#### 🚀 CI/CD Pipelines
- **CircleCI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins**: Automating the deployment so I can kick back and sip mint tea.

#### ☁️ Cloud Services and Platforms
- **AWS**: The giant cloud that could, and does, everything.
- **GCP**: Google’s secret sauce to world domination (and my cloud of choice).
- **DigitalOcean**: Droplets that make cloud computing a breeze.
- **Hetzner**: For when you need power without breaking the bank.
- **Vercel & Cloudflare**: Making sure my sites are fast and secure, because why compromise?

#### 🗄️ Databases
- **MongoDB**: The NoSQL powerhouse for all things document-based.
- **PostgreSQL**: SQL’s sophisticated cousin with a taste for the finer data.
- **Redis**: Speeding things up like a cache-pro on a mission.

### 🛠️ What I'm Working On
> I'm currently working on something amazing, but it's all under wraps for now—stay tuned!

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- **Advanced Kubernetes**: Because clusters are better when they’re complicated.
- **Web3 & Blockchain**: Decentralization is the future, and I’m all in.
- **Zig & Rust**: “Because if coding languages were food, Zig would be the spicy new dish, and Rust would be that robust meal that builds your muscles.”
